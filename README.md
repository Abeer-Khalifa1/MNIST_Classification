# MNIST_Classification
This project is a comprehensive exploration of machine learning models applied to the MNIST handwritten digit classification task. It systematically progresses from simple linear models (Logistic and Softmax Regression) to custom-built feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch.
